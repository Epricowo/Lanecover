# Lanecover
Lanecover for VSRG games E.g O2jam.</br>
- To download just download the "Lane_cover.rar" everything should be there.<br/>
- Keybinds are F1 for settings menu, TAB to turn always on top off/on, Escape to exit the settings menu.


# --WARNING--
currently do not know wether this is "allowed" for VSRG's like "DPJAM" so please be weary.


# Todo
- Make the Lanecover have a toggle for draggable / not draggable and have it save in the settings.json -- ready for next update<br/>
- Make the lanecover save the last position the lanecover was when exiting and while booting up (should) use that X and Y -- ready for next update<br/>
- Make the program not ask for administrator (it shouldn't need it in the first place) -- ready for next update
